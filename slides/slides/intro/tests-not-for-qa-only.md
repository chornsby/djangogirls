##  Tests are not for QA<br> people only

### Different levels of testing

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
* Acceptance testing

    <p>
    There are generally four recognized levels of tests: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Tests are frequently grouped by where they are added in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test.
    </p>
    <p>
    <dt>Unit testing</dt>
    <dd>Unit testing, also known as component testing, refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the function level.
    <br><br>
    Unit testing alone cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but rather is used to ensure that the building blocks of the software work independently from each other.
    <br><br>
    It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments it. Unit testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA.</dd>

    <dt>Integration testing</dt>

    <dd>Integration testing is any type of software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together ("big bang"). Normally the former is considered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be located more quickly and fixed.
    <br><br>
    Integration testing works to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between integrated components (modules). Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system.[33]</dd>

    <dt>System testing</dt>

    <dd>System testing, or end-to-end testing, tests a completely integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements.[36] For example, a system test might involve testing a logon interface, then creating and editing an entry, plus sending or printing results, followed by summary processing or deletion (or archiving) of entries, then logoff.
    <br><br>
    In addition, the software testing should ensure that the program, as well as working as expected, does not also destroy or partially corrupt its operating environment or cause other processes within that environment to become inoperative (this includes not corrupting shared memory, not consuming or locking up excessive resources and leaving any parallel processes unharmed by its presence).[citation needed]</dd>

    <dt>Acceptance testing</dt>

    <dd>At last the system is delivered to the user for Acceptance testing.</dd>
