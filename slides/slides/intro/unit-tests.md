    <dt>Find problems early</dt>
    <dd>Unit testing finds problems early in the development circle. In TDD, tests are often written before development. When tests pass, the code can be considered to be ready.</dd>
    <dt>Facilitates change</dt>
    <dd>Unit tests allow for safer refactoring. Everything doesn't need to be manually checked during a refactoring process if there is good test coverage.</dd>
    <dt>Documentation</dt>
    <dd>Unit tests provide a sort of documentation of the system. Developers can use existing unit tests to understand critical functionality of the system.</dd>
    <dt>Design</dt>
    <dd>Unit tests help with design. While writing tests one has to think about the practical implementation of the code.</dd>
